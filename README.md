## 📚 Continuous Learning

I'm all about learning. Right now, I'm really digging into Java and Spring Boot. I'm also looking forward to learning more about cloud technologies and how to build microservices. As a full-stack JavaScript Developer, I know how important it is to keep learning other languages too.

## 👨‍🍳 Personal Life & Hobbies

When I'm not busy turning coffee into code or working as a laborer at a paper mill, I am a man of many passions. Here are a few things I enjoy:

- 🎣 Going fishing and hunting in the great outdoors
- 🏕️ Engaging in camping trips with my family
- 🎸 Playing the guitar and drums - I love making music!
- 🚗 Acting as the family mechanic, I'm currently working on putting a Mercedes turbo diesel in my Toyota pickup - it's a labor of love
- 🐶 Playing with my English bulldog, Earl, and taking care of my lovely pet family that includes 3 dogs and 3 cats
- 👨‍👩‍👦 Spending quality time with my wife and my two boys

Life is all about balance, and these activities help keep me grounded.
